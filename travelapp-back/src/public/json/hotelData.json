It is centrally located in downtown Albany, on a quiet, tree-lined residential street overlooking Washington Park and was the longtime home of the artist and suffragette Alice Morgan Wright (1881&mdash;1975), who lived here from 1888 (when she was 7 years old) until her death. The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s. Alice Morgan Wright was a leading figure in the American suffrage movement and once was jailed in London with Emmeline Pankhurst. In 1921 she helped found the New York League of Women’s Voters. An influential artist of the Art Deco style, Wright maintained a studio on the fourth floor of the house, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the country.",

After dark, its lights turn on automatically when someone approaches the station. Campsite fees are good until 12 noon, more than a single day can be paid for at one time.  First-come, first-serve, no reservations. 94 sites, no hook-ups, but centrally-located water taps and a dump station are available.  Each site has a paved parking pad, picnic table and fire grill. Parking pads, picnic tables and tent sites are nearly all sloped, a few pieces of 2 inch x 6 inch slabs of wood will usually prove helpful in levelling vehicles and picnic tables.  During extreme fire hazard conditions building of fires in the grills may be prohibited. It is always a good idea to bring a fueled stove for cooking rather than to rely only on the possibility of building a fire in the grill. The restrooms have electrical outlets, flush toilets, sinks with hand soap dispensers, and special sanitary sinks to dump small portable toilets and gray water from dishwashing.  No showers (available for a fee at the public pool and the YMCA in Los Alamos, 12 miles/20&nbsp;km away).  Limit 10 people/2 vehicles/3 tents per site.  Firewood gathering is not permitted. Pets are permitted only in campsites, parking areas, or along roadways, and must be on leash.

Ateş is run by a small friendly family, and they're happy to give free information on just about any activity in Kaş. Good home-cooked meals are a welcome change to kebabs and pide. Guests have access to the swimming pool in the hotel across the road, but most people are better off strolling the few extra metres down to the seafront, where free sun-loungers are available and the snorkelling is excellent.",

    "overview": "Open all year. Aux Jardins de l'Anse is situated in a rather strange location—an out-of-the-way, almost isolated part of inland L'Anse-à-Beaufils—but it's perfect for those visiting Percé during the winter, a time when, unlike most area hoteliers, owners Odette and Jean-Guy are as busy as any other season. In fact, taking good care of offseason visitors at a time when most services are closed seems to be a major point of pride here, with a long slate of winter activities on offer including dogsledding excursions ''([[Percé#In the winter|q.v.]])'', sleigh rides, and snowmobiling. But Aux Jardins de l'Anse is perfect for the other three seasons too, with lobster fishing excursions in the spring, brilliant colours covering the mountains in the fall, and the gardens that give the place its name providing a summertime floral feast for the eyes and nose. The main house boasts four rooms, all with lovely views either over the gardens or out to the sea in the distance; the &quot;Petite Suite&quot; boasts a queen size bed, private bath and lounge and Internet access while the other three have double beds, shared baths and peaceful sitting areas. There's also a detached chalet with a private terrace, a full-size private bath, and additional amenities such as a refrigerator and barbecue grill. Breakfast comes either as a gourmet five-course meal in the midmorning or as an abbreviated continental breakfast beginning at 6AM: perfect for early-rising hikers hitting the '''River Trail''' a short walk away.

The first time the Wallace family came to the Luangwa Valley in eastern Zambia were overwhelmed by the diverse and plentiful wildlife and the wildness of the Nsefu sector and the main South Luangwa National Park. The place or area is a trip back in time to old Africa where the people are friendly, and the wildlife is abundant. There is an old African saying which goes something like this; “once you get the dust of Africa on your boots, you will never be able to kick it off”. In other words; once you experience Africa, it will be in your heart forever. Wildlife is in danger all over the world, and especially in Africa. Photographic safari camps are one of the best ways to save wildlife as they; bring tourists in for the best safari explore, create jobs for locals, which makes both parties (the tourists and the locals) value their wildlife and habitat which helps save the animals for the whole world. The intention was to become part of larger conservation efforts taking place in the Luangwa valley and so we built Zikomo Safari Camp( the word Zikomo means thank you in a local dialect).",

Two channels of centrally-selected satellite TV are available in most of the rooms and almost all have an ''en suite'' shower, wash hand basin and WC. Make sure you ask for a mosquito net since most of the room windows are not screened. Intermittent Wi-Fi via Orange cellular ISP and a meagre breakfast is included in their tariff. The 8 bunk dormitory on the first floor is a light and airy room with windows (without net screening) opening on to a mature shade tree. The large bathroom for this dorm actually has a hip bath and hot water and each bunk has individual mosquito nets. Popular with those few UN staff that have to pay for their own accommodation. Main business is budget safaris.

There is a laundry with coin operated washers and dryers, dish washing facilities (''including boiling water on tap'') as well as Telkom card and coin pay phones. The only problem with the camp is the large number of pine trees that consume huge amounts of water causing some of the stands to be devoid of grass. After the summer rains this is not as big a problem, but if you visit during the winter it is best to avoid electric stands 1 to 14 and 42 to 50; electrical stands 15 to 25 will have a lot more grass cover and less dust. If you do not require electricity, non-electrical stands 3 to 5 are probably the best in the whole camp. There are two security guards on 24 hour duty in the camp, mostly to ensure that wildlife that wander in is promptly escorted out again (''Baboons seldom come near the camps as they are shot at with paintball guns to scare them away, but bushbuck often wander in'').",

The restaurant is OK and offers a nice view of the valley. Rooms have showers and mosquito nets, but as of 2014 were in poor repair, with electric sockets falling out of the walls, toilet seats missing, etc. The lodge is the closest accommodation to the park's main trekking area, but still not close enough that you would choose to walk instead of taking a vehicle.

Building a frame house in Breckenridge before the arrival of the railroad was no small task. To erect this c.1881 house and the one next door (301 N. Main),Breckenridge saloonkeeper Joseph F. Reeder had to chop down trees, drag them to the sawmill, have them milled for different uses—siding, flooring, shingles, etc.—and let them dry. Inflating the cost of construction was the need to pack finished building materials—nails, paint, and doors— over a high mountain pass at a cost of forty cents per pound. In 1888, John Williams, a hardrock miner, and his wife, Minta, purchased the house as their home. After John and Minta’s separation in 1890, Minta and their daughter, Ethel, continued to live here until 1906, renting it out from time to time as they pursued an acting career for Ethel. The Williams House is featured in the Historic Walking Tour.",

It's located on busy Route 132, but in a quiet location on the outskirts of Pabos, with a peaceful terraced garden in back with sweeping views over Chaleur Bay, and a private beach and kayak launch to boot. Breakfasts are artfully prepared in-house, and Madeleine's homemade jams are legendary—but the preparation happens the night before and the food is refrigerated overnight in the kitchen, with guests left to make their own plates in the morning. The guest lounge and kitchen are spacious and inviting, but tucked away in the basement and, in the case of the kitchen, only open during breakfast time—another of those house rules Madeleine enforces strictly. If you can take the good with the bad, Parfum de Mer might be for you. There's three guest rooms, with decor that's pleasant if a bit dated: two boast a full size bed and come with en suite bathroom and kitchenette, hair dryers, iron and ironing board, and free WiFi; the third room is somewhat larger, with a queen bed and all of the above-listed amenities plus cable TV and soundproof walls.

There's no key; just punch in code (the last 4 digits of your phone number, if you gave it at reservation - and you should) into the pad by your door. The rooms facing the river come with a beautiful view but also with the (muted) traffic noise from the street. Please note that the proprietors close the front desk and go home at 6; if you are planning on a late arrival, e-mail them and they'll send you your room number and the access code to enter the building.",
