It is centrally located in downtown Albany, on a quiet, tree-lined residential street overlooking Washington Park and was the longtime home of the artist and suffragette Alice Morgan Wright (1881&mdash;1975), who lived here from 1888 (when she was 7 years old) until her death. The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s. Alice Morgan Wright was a leading figure in the American suffrage movement and once was jailed in London with Emmeline Pankhurst. In 1921 she helped found the New York League of Women’s Voters. An influential artist of the Art Deco style, Wright maintained a studio on the fourth floor of the house, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the country.",

After dark, its lights turn on automatically when someone approaches the station. Campsite fees are good until 12 noon, more than a single day can be paid for at one time.  First-come, first-serve, no reservations. 94 sites, no hook-ups, but centrally-located water taps and a dump station are available.  Each site has a paved parking pad, picnic table and fire grill. Parking pads, picnic tables and tent sites are nearly all sloped, a few pieces of 2 inch x 6 inch slabs of wood will usually prove helpful in levelling vehicles and picnic tables.  During extreme fire hazard conditions building of fires in the grills may be prohibited. It is always a good idea to bring a fueled stove for cooking rather than to rely only on the possibility of building a fire in the grill. The restrooms have electrical outlets, flush toilets, sinks with hand soap dispensers, and special sanitary sinks to dump small portable toilets and gray water from dishwashing.  No showers (available for a fee at the public pool and the YMCA in Los Alamos, 12 miles/20&nbsp;km away).  Limit 10 people/2 vehicles/3 tents per site.  Firewood gathering is not permitted. Pets are permitted only in campsites, parking areas, or along roadways, and must be on leash.

In fact, taking good care of offseason visitors at a time when most services are closed seems to be a major point of pride here, with a long slate of winter activities on offer including dogsledding excursions ''([[Percé#In the winter|q.v.]])'', sleigh rides, and snowmobiling. But Aux Jardins de l'Anse is perfect for the other three seasons too, with lobster fishing excursions in the spring, brilliant colours covering the mountains in the fall, and the gardens that give the place its name providing a summertime floral feast for the eyes and nose. The main house boasts four rooms, all with lovely views either over the gardens or out to the sea in the distance; the &quot;Petite Suite&quot; boasts a queen size bed, private bath and lounge and Internet access while the other three have double beds, shared baths and peaceful sitting areas. There's also a detached chalet with a private terrace, a full-size private bath, and additional amenities such as a refrigerator and barbecue grill.

It definitely has the best view of all the hotels in Bamiyan, but the rooms are dirty and they do not maintain the rooms very well. They advertise hot water, but it's available only about half the time and you need to take quick showers because it runs out fast. Also, it is difficult to get to town since it's on top of a hill. If you want to eat at the hotel, the prices are set and are expensive. 500 Afs for lunch, 500 Afs for dinner. Paying 500 Afs for local food is extremely expensive. Even with all these faults, if you want great views, there isn't a better place than the Roof of Bamiyan.",

The Beau Fleuve Bed & Breakfast Inn has operated since 1990 in the former '''Albert J. Wright House''' on Linwood Avenue. The themes of the Beau Fleuve's five guest rooms were chosen in honor of the immigrant communities who populated Buffalo over the course of the 19th century and fueled its industrial might—French, Irish, German, Italian, and Polish people predominant among them. The Beau Fleuve offers its guests central AC, minibars, coffeemakers, and other amenities in their impeccably decorated and luxuriously appointed rooms.

The first time the Wallace family came to the Luangwa Valley in eastern Zambia were overwhelmed by the diverse and plentiful wildlife and the wildness of the Nsefu sector and the main South Luangwa National Park. The place or area is a trip back in time to old Africa where the people are friendly, and the wildlife is abundant. There is an old African saying which goes something like this; “once you get the dust of Africa on your boots, you will never be able to kick it off”. In other words; once you experience Africa, it will be in your heart forever. Wildlife is in danger all over the world, and especially in Africa. Photographic safari camps are one of the best ways to save wildlife as they; bring tourists in for the best safari explore, create jobs for locals, which makes both parties (the tourists and the locals) value their wildlife and habitat which helps save the animals for the whole world. The intention was to become part of larger conservation efforts taking place in the Luangwa valley and so we built Zikomo Safari Camp( the word Zikomo means thank you in a local dialect).",

None of the bedroom windows are screened and the street side rooms (the majority) are noisy with no Wi-Fi reception. Inside rooms are noisier too, since their windows open on to the 2nd storey breakfast area which is itself a sort of long, open balcony. You won't need an alarm call for an early flight - the pre-dawn ''Adhan'' or Muslim call to prayer about 05:29 and again about 05:42 is at boom-box levels. You won't hear the midnight Adhan, because that will mostly be drowned out by the pounding music from an open-air pub/barbecue that continues until about four o'clock in the morning. There are 3 rooms here that can receive Wi-Fi reception: 206, 208, & 210 and here you'll be able to hold a VoIP video conference since the Wi-Fi connection is strong, fast and reliable.",

By day, the &quot;Foundry Lounge&quot; downstairs features coffee in a relaxing ambience; by night you can enjoy a rousing game of pool while bartenders whip you up an upscale mixed drink. The Foundry Suites also provides guests with free parking, free concierge service, free passes to '''LA Fitness''', and a 24-hour business center. Also, the location, while it may seem out-of-the-way at first glance, is quite convenient: the boutiques and restaurants of the Elmwood Village and Hertel Avenue, the greenery of Delaware Park, and the cultural attractions of the Museum District are all within easy striking distance.",

The 8 bunk dormitory on the first floor is a light and airy room with windows (without net screening) opening on to a mature shade tree. The large bathroom for this dorm actually has a hip bath and hot water and each bunk has individual mosquito nets. Popular with those few UN staff that have to pay for their own accommodation.

The only problem with the camp is the large number of pine trees that consume huge amounts of water causing some of the stands to be devoid of grass. After the summer rains this is not as big a problem, but if you visit during the winter it is best to avoid electric stands 1 to 14 and 42 to 50; electrical stands 15 to 25 will have a lot more grass cover and less dust. If you do not require electricity, non-electrical stands 3 to 5 are probably the best in the whole camp.

The lodge does boast an impressive view from rooms perched on the hillside, and the walk up to the rooms passes by a mountain stream and lush vegetation, but the downside of this view is that you'll have to trek up an impressive number of stairs to get to the room. The restaurant is OK and offers a nice view of the valley. Rooms have showers and mosquito nets, but as of 2014 were in poor repair, with electric sockets falling out of the walls, toilet seats missing, etc. The lodge is the closest accommodation to the park's main trekking area, but still not close enough that you would choose to walk instead of taking a vehicle. Should you choose to stay here, you will need to make your payment in person in their office in Antananarivo prior to arrival, and only cash will be accepted.",

Basically, everywhere outside the tourist spot is perfect, because at night all the tourists either leave or stay in the tourist area. Momijidani is just an example park, this island is full of good spots.",

At the time, the honeymoon suite was a remodeled horse stable that occupied a spot on the property owned by the groom’s parents at 322 South Main Street. When the newlyweds moved out in 1903, Ralph’s father put the cottage up for lease. The newspaper ad read, “FOR RENT. CABIN WITH OR WITHOUT BACHING OUTFIT. INQUIRE OF R. W. WILLOUGHBY.” The tiny cottage was moved to the current location in 1990 and restored as a romantic cabin. The Cottage is featured on the Breckenridge historical walking tour.",

But that's not the only superlative that applies to the Asa Ransom House—today, it is known as almost inarguably the best-known and best-loved lodging in Clarence, as well as the most elegant and charming bed & breakfast in Erie County. Its restaurant is lauded by many locals as their favorite, the most elegant, the most romantic, ad infinitum. The ten rooms at the Asa Ransom House are delightfully appointed with period furniture, distinctive, individualized decor in eclectic styles, and lovely and serene views of the impeccably manicured grounds. All rooms contain private baths, radio and hidden TV with cable, free WiFi, individual climate-control units, hair dryers, and irons and ironing boards; all but one of the rooms also has a fireplace. Some rooms also contain refrigerators and porches or balconies. Additionally, a full country breakfast is provided to guests each morning.",

Building a frame house in Breckenridge before the arrival of the railroad was no small task. To erect this c.1881 house and the one next door (301 N. Main),Breckenridge saloonkeeper Joseph F. Reeder had to chop down trees, drag them to the sawmill, have them milled for different uses—siding, flooring, shingles, etc.—and let them dry. Inflating the cost of construction was the need to pack finished building materials—nails, paint, and doors— over a high mountain pass at a cost of forty cents per pound. In 1888, John Williams, a hardrock miner, and his wife, Minta, purchased the house as their home. After John and Minta’s separation in 1890, Minta and their daughter, Ethel, continued to live here until 1906, renting it out from time to time as they pursued an acting career for Ethel.

It's located on busy Route 132, but in a quiet location on the outskirts of Pabos, with a peaceful terraced garden in back with sweeping views over Chaleur Bay, and a private beach and kayak launch to boot. Breakfasts are artfully prepared in-house, and Madeleine's homemade jams are legendary—but the preparation happens the night before and the food is refrigerated overnight in the kitchen, with guests left to make their own plates in the morning. The guest lounge and kitchen are spacious and inviting, but tucked away in the basement and, in the case of the kitchen, only open during breakfast time—another of those house rules Madeleine enforces strictly. If you can take the good with the bad, Parfum de Mer might be for you. There's three guest rooms, with decor that's pleasant if a bit dated: two boast a full size bed and come with en suite bathroom and kitchenette, hair dryers, iron and ironing board, and free WiFi; the third room is somewhat larger, with a queen bed and all of the above-listed amenities plus cable TV and soundproof walls.
